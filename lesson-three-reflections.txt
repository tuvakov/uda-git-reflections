# REFLECTION #1: When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repos are great if one works on the same projects from 
several computers. The remote repo will be a common place
to keep the main codebase. Likewise, the logic applies to 
managing a project collobratively.

# REFLECTION #2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we might not always stay up-to-date with remote. For instance, if some
unwanted change is pushed to the remote by someone else automatic pull will
bring that change to the local and may mess up the code.

# REFLECTIONS #3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is cloning a repo that you don't have permission to change directly to
your GitHub. So, better to use this one if we want to clone someone else's
project, change it and share back on GitHub.

Cloning is literally copying a entire repo to another location. It is useful for
copying a repo from remote or from local. 

Branching doesn't involve any copying. It just supplies a new path to work
within a repo whilst keeping existing code intact. 

I would say unless we don't need to update or change a project entirely
branching is good option to try out new things. Otherwise, cloning would be a
better option. I guess other use cases of branches and clones are mutually
exclusive.

# REFLECTION #4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of
the remote stored locally?

Firstly, it makes a lot easier to compare local changes with the remote even
in offline situations. And also as the instructors said it helps to merge the
local and remote repos.

# REFLECTION #5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What 
would be easier, and what would be harder?

I guess keeping a remote on GitHub and updating it as project advances would be
a good start. Easier thing is of course the version control and pushing/pulling
files with a few commands. But I would say the harder thing is definetely merge
conflicts and processing them properly without breaking anything.

# REFLECTIONS #6: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch 
rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I assume this question is related to master in the remote. I think I will make
changes directly into master if I'm working alone or the feature I'm working
doesn't mix with other developers' code. In other cases, it's good idea to get
their conformation before commiting any change to master branch by using
seperate branches and pull requests.
