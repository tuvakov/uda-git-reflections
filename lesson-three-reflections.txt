# REFLECTION #1: When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repos are great if one works on the same projects from 
several computers. The remote repo will be a common place
to keep the main codebase. Likewise, the logic applies to 
managing a project collobratively.

# REFLECTION #2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we might not always stay up-to-date with remote. For instance, if some
unwanted change is pushed to the remote by someone else automatic pull will
bring that change to the local and may mess up the code.
