# REFLECTION #1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need 
to do it?

When we initialize a Git repository, Git adds generates a metadata about the
repository, more specifically it adds status info about the uncommitted files
and etc. In order to be able to use Git and its version control features we
have to initialze a repository. Otherwise, we cannot simply use it.


# REFLECTION #2: How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository contains the whole code base (or whatever it's being used for)
along with commit history and other metadata about the repository. On the other
hands the staging area only contains files that will be committed together in
the next commit. Without staging area we will need to either commit each file
seperately or commit the whole repository which is not the most practical way of
doing things most of the times. To summarize, the staging area offers a ability
to gather files together that will be commited in the next commit and freely
change contents before comitting.
